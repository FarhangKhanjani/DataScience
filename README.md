# Data Science Projects 📊🚀

Welcome to my **Data Science Portfolio**! This repository contains various **end-to-end Data Science projects** that I have worked on, covering topics such as:

✅ Machine Learning (Classification, Regression, Clustering)  
✅ Deep Learning (Neural Networks, NLP, Computer Vision)  
✅ Data Analysis & Visualization  
✅ Time Series Forecasting  
✅ AI-powered applications  

Each project is organized into its own folder and includes:  
📌 **Jupyter Notebooks / Python Scripts**  
📌 **Dataset (or link to it)**  
📌 **Code for preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation**  
📌 **Project Summary & Insights (README)**  

### 🏗 **Ongoing Work**
I will **continuously update** this repo with new projects. Stay tuned!  

### 💡 **How to Use?**
1. Browse the project folders and read the README for details.  
2. Clone the repo and run the notebooks locally.  
3. Feel free to contribute or discuss improvements!
